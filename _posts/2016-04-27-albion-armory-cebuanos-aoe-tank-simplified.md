When fighting a lot of mobs, specially the undead its not enough to just have someone to be the meat shield. We need someone to tank with style!

* Equipment

1.) Broadsword & Shield 

2.) Guardian Helmet & Boots

3.) Mercenary Jacket (Chest)

* Skills

**Q** - (_Broadsword_) Attack your target and everyone very close to it, for 253 damage. 

**W** - (_Broadsword_) Taunts your enemies, as well as increasing the chance that close enemy will attack you.

**E **-****(_Broadsword_) Increases move speed by 44% and armor / magic resist by 129, for 5 seconds.

**R - **(_Chest_)****Unleashes an electric field around you, dealing 78 damage twice per second to every enemy around you. Lasts for 8 seconds.

**D - **(_Helmet_) Increases magic and armor resist by 386 at the expense of reducing your damage by 50%

**F** - (_Boots_) Increases your move speed by 100% for 3 sec. and regenerates 41 health every second. Lasts for 3 seconds.

With the **Q** attack you can hit more than one target in very close proximity, the **W** will be your taunting and the **E** increases your movement speed with some hint of defense. 

**R **will be for your AOE (Area of Effect) spell with matching **D **for more defense and just in case push comes to shove use **F** to flee!

> Once you and your team mastered how the synergy of the build works, **OP'**ness could happen.
